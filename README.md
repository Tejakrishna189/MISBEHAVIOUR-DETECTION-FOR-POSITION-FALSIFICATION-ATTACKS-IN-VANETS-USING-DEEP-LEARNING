# Misbehaviour-detection-for-position-falsification-attacks-in-VANETs-using-deep-learning

Dataset which I used for this project is from https://github.com/VeReMi-dataset/VeReMi/releases
Open the above link and download all the 225 simulations and then extract them now click on each simulation then you will find a folder named result copy that folder now create a new folder name it data now paste that copied folder into the dataset folder repeat the same process for all remained simulations
After extracting results from all the 225 simulations now apply the dataset.ipynb code which I uploaded in the working code folder change the paths to respective paths where you saved the data folder
Now by  applying the k means algorithm which I uploaded in the working code folder we get clusters that gives us attacker type and attacker position
And then we use the gaussian mixture model to reduce the colliding in clusters and it is used to maximize the result this code is uploaded in the working code folder
